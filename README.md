# Holberton ToolKit


Holberton ToolKIT is a modular, extensible toolkit for cybersecurity learning and automation.
It is designed for legal, educational, and ethical hacking purposes only.

Overview

Holberton ToolKIT aims to provide a collection of small, focused modules that help with:

Information gathering and reconnaissance

Automation of repetitive security tasks

Experimenting with different techniques in a controlled, lab environment

The project is built as a toolbox, not a single monolithic program. Each module is responsible for a specific task and can be used independently or combined into larger workflows.

Project Goals

Learn and practice Python and security concepts in a structured way

Have a clear and maintainable project structure for future expansion

Make it easy to add, remove, or update tools without breaking the whole project

Keep all usage within legal and ethical boundaries
